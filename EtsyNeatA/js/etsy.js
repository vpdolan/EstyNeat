FOLK YEAH!!\n\nSilk screened by hand on a mens dusty sage green crew neck tee. The black illustration is printed on a tri- blended 50% polyester, 25% rayon, 25% cotton pre-washed tee.

Give me a shout!\r\n\r\nAll artwork, reproductions, and images on https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/KustomProducts are copyrighted (c) by Kathleen Cheever. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nCommon Questions:\r\n\r\n1. How long until I get my products?\r\n\r\nProcessing time for all items is 1-2 weeks. Please remember that each item is customized to your specifications and therefore take a little time to create.\r\n\r\n2. I need my items quicker then the processing time offered is this possible?\r\n\r\nYes! Rush processing is available however there will be an extra fee involved. Rush processing fee is based on the number of items, weight of items, where the items will be shipped to, and how quickly those items are needed. All rush processes are &quot;after hours.&quot; No item will reserve priority over another and all items all processed in the order that they are received. If you need an order rushed, the order will be fulfilled after hours so to not effect the order of the other items. Please note that part of the rush processing fee is the cost of an employee working after hours.\r\n\r\n3. What are the extra fees and why are there extra fees?\r\n\r\nThe extra fees will very by item. Some of the extra fees could be:\r\n-Priority Shipping-based on the amount and weight of the item along with where the items need to be shipped to.\r\n-Rush Processing-Please understand that EVERYONE needs\/wants their items as quickly as possible and one customer&#39;s item will for NO reason be placed in priority over another customers item. Because of this all rush processing orders are filled after hours or on weekends and will occur and rush processing fee. All rush processing fees will be in the range of $10-$100 depending on the size of the project and how quickly the items are needed.\r\n\r\n4. What mail carrier do you use and how long will it take to receive my items once they are shipped.\r\n\r\nAt the current time my main provider is USPS with very few packages being shipped out FedEx. USPS website states the following for shipping in the 48 USA:\r\nAll items under 13 oz 2-5 days\r\nAll other items 2-9 days\r\nPriority items 2-3 days\r\nUSPS Shipping outside the USA:\r\nFirst Class Mail 5-16 Business Days\r\nPriority Mail 6-10 Business Days\r\nExpress Mail 3-5 Business Days\r\n\r\n**ALL customs can stop and hold packages for any amount of time and is not covered by shipping times\r\n\r\n5. I am a foreign buyer, what fee will be associated with my package? \r\n\r\nAll countries have their own fee associated with packages being mailed in from a foreign buyer.  Please contact the appropriate government agency to find out what your fees will be.  All packages will be marked as goods sold without exception.  All fees relating to the package within the buyers country will be the responsibility of the buyer.\r\n\r\n6. Do you accept returns?\r\n\r\nNo returns will be accepted on any personalized items.  Do to the customization of the items they can not be resold to another customer and therefore all sales on these items are finial.\r\n\r\n7. Do you accept cancellations on your items?\r\n\r\nCancellations on items will be accepted within a 24 hour time period as long as the item has not been currently worked on or in production. Currently worked on or in production items also includes any custom items that included mock ups\/proofs. Due to the time constants of mock ups\/proofs these items are considered &quot;in production&quot; and cannot be canceled once started. All items that have not been started but are passed the 24 hour time limit will be given as credit of funds towards the shop for a future purchase within 265 day from original purchase date.\r\n \r\n8. Do you do proofs\/mock ups\/pictures of your items?\r\n\r\nDue to work load I do not do proofs\/mock ups\/pictures of items at no cost, doing so would add a 2-4 day extra processing time for all items. The reason is every day I get 25-50 requests for such items, the average mock up\/picture takes 5-20 minutes a piece resulting in 2-17 hours a day. If you would like a proof\/mock up\/picture of your item an extra $5 charge will be added onto your item cost per proof needed.\r\n\r\n9. For custom Images:\r\n\r\nAll images need to be in a vector style format as well as black and white.  A vector image is made up of paths not of pixels which results in clean lines that the laser can read. Any none vector image (.jpg for example) shows pixels which the laser will pick up and engrave onto your objects resulting in an image that will look blurry. The acceptable vector formats are: .ai, .cdr, .eps. Please note that most .png images will not be acceptable. \r\nIf you have an image that is not a vector format such as a .jpg  that you would like to use I can either have a graphic artist trace it out for you at a cost of $25-$50 or you can go to a site such as www.vectormagic.com  where you can sign up for free and get multiple conversions into a vector image. If you go this route I would need the .eps file that you download from the site.\r\nThe cost of a custom item after the black and white vector is received varies on the size of the image and the item the image is to be engraved on. Cost range from $2.50 per item to $40 for large items. If you are looking for multiple items for a company or another occasion discounts for large quantity orders will be given.\r\nAll vector images need to be sent to Kate@KustomProductsInc.com because Etsy does not currently support vector style uploads.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Why are the silver flasks more expensive then the other flasks?\r\n\r\nThe silver flasks cost more then the other flasks due to production costs. In order to produce the mark on a silver flask a marking agent must be used. The marking agent is a very expensive spray that reacts with the heat of the laser.  After the marking agent is placed the item that is being marked the item must be marked at a high heat and at a very low speed that takes 4 times longer then other similar items.\r\n\r\n11. LAYAWAY: I know that wedding budgeting can be tricky and sometime it is just easier to pay a few payments then one lump sum. For that reason layaway will now be available on purchases of $250 or more.  Please read the following rules carefully:\r\n-Layaway is for purchases of $250 or more. If you would like layaway on a purchase less then this please contact me and I will see if something can be arranged.\r\n-A 10% layaway fee will be added to the cost of your order. For a $250 order this would be $25.\r\n-Layaway payments can be made by credit card via Etsy and\/or PayPal. No checks or money orders will be accepted.\r\n-There will be no refunds of money for any lawaway purchases. All money that is currently paid to the shop can be used as shop credit only minus the layaway fee.\r\n-1\/3 is due on purchase, 1\/3 in 30 days, and the balance in 60 days\r\n","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1436894537,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/KustomProducts?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/029\/0\/8619330\/iusb_760x100.12691977_k44j.jpg","num_favorers":472,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":null}},{"listing_id":191971582,"state":"active","user_id":17442152,"category_id":68892008,"title":"Woodford Reserve bourbon whiskey barrel head","description":"We all know the tradition of Kentucky bourbon.

These are typically set up to printed on a standard letter sized sheet and each label should be cut to approximately 4&quot; x 3.25&quot;. \r\n\r\nTypically you can use a full shipping label and have it printed on any commercial printer. For instance Office Depot, etc all can print for $0.70 per copy and can even cut it for you!  Or you can send the file to a printer and they will print on cut on their professional machines.   \r\n\r\nIf you are printing labels instead of tags I do not suggest purchasing pre-cut (Avery for instance) labels and attempting to line up the file to their layout.  It is definitely easiest to print the file on a full sheet and cut to your dimensions!\r\n\r\nHope they are a hit!\r\nRachel","last_updated_tsz":1444250061,"listing_active_count":132,"login_name":"RDMULLET","accepts_custom_requests":false,"policy_welcome":"Thank you for visiting my shop!  Feel free to look around at the many designs I have.  Stay tuned...more designs for all occasions coming soon!","policy_payment":null,"policy_shipping":"Standard orders in the US ship in 2 business days and are typically 3-5 business days once shipped (or 5-7 business days to your door from the time of placing your order.) \r\n\r\nI also offer 3 expedited services you can choose at check out. \r\n\r\n1)  PRIORITY SHIPPING $3.50 upgrade-  Typically 4-6 business days to your door.\r\n2)  RUSH $12.00 upgrade - Ships next business day PRIORITY  Typically 3-4 business days to your door from placing order.  Insurance included.\r\n3)  EXPRESS $26.45 upgrade - Next day (or same day if possible) turnaround and EXPRESS shipping (typically 1-2 day service).  1-3 days to your door from placing order.  Insurance Included.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind RUSH EXPRESS is the only shipping option guaranteed by USPS!  You can purchase any of these shipping upgrades at check-out under &quot;Shipping&quot; if needed.\r\n\r\nINSURANCE: Please note that PRIORITY, RUSH & EXPRESS services include insurance for lost or damaged mail.  Standard shipping does NOT include insurance.  Please purchase an upgraded shipping option if you wish to insure your package!\r\n\r\nUSPS and I have a love\/hate relationship.  I love their prices (and so do you) but I hate it when they don&#39;t deliver on time.  Ug.  Which takes me to my next point--\r\nUSPS DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY SHIPPING TIMES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPRESS.  Sad but true.  Express in most cases, is overnight delivery and is a flat rate of $21.45 to US residents.  For those of you willing to fork it over, please message me for Express delivery option.  Keep in mind if you need 2 day turnaround to your door--you&#39;d need to purchase the RUSH option as well.  This bumps you to the front of every line.\r\n\r\nUSPS recognizes M-F as considered &quot;Postal Business Days&quot;.  Please keep this in mind when doing the math on when to expect your order!\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell:\r\n\r\nStandard Shipping (4-6 business days to your door)\r\nRUSH Shipping (3-4 business days to your door)\r\nEXPRESS Shipping (2 business days to your door excluding extreme rural areas which is 3 business days) USPS guarantees this method or your shipping money back.  Purchase an upgraded shipping option to insure your package.\r\n\r\nI have had very few issues with the USPS however it does happen.  Typically 5 out of every 100.  I take a lot of pride in my labels as they are all edited one at a time--Trust me when I say I would hand deliver them if I could! :)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\r\nInternational shipping is typically 2-3 weeks depending on its destination and how long it takes to process through customs (which always varies.)  USPS does not guarantee these shipping times and from time-to-time there are significant delays in Customs.  USPS does offer guaranteed services (which are super expensive but again, guaranteed.)  Please message me directly if you are interested in International guaranteed USPS delivery. \r\n\r\n7-11 Day RUSH International Ship (Business Days) \t$30.50 USD\r\n9-14 Day International Shipping (Business Days) \t$25.50 USDD\r\n4-6 Day RUSH International Shipping \t$45.75 USD\r\n\r\n***PLEASE NOTE from time to time International buyers are forced to pay customs fees and\/or taxes that are levied on many packages being imported into some countries.  Because sellers are unable to predict what fees, if any, certain countries will apply, Etsy does not hold sellers responsible for unexpected customs fees or taxes.  In my experience I have only seen this through Royal Mail.  Just a heads up!","policy_refunds":"No refunds offered once the design process has begun.

I am so glad that you have decided to visit. I have so many custom products to look at that I am sure that you will find something that you love.  Check back often as I am thinking up new ideas and adding new products every month! ","policy_payment":"Kustom Products Inc accepts payment via Direct Checkout as well as PayPal. In some cases I even accept trade (never hurts to ask!)\r\nCalifornia residents are subject to a 8% sales tax, sorry friends! But look at the bright side, you probably saved a ton on shipping!","policy_shipping":"Kustom Products Inc is happy to ship anywhere in the world, as long as your part of the world allows my products!\r\nAll items are careful packaged with love using as many recycled products as I can. \r\nAll items have a 1-2 week turn around time not including shipping due to the time it takes to customize each piece.\r\nBoth domestic and international packages are shipped USPS and FedEx at this time.

During seasonal times delivery could take up to 4-5 weeks.  Also please note that any buyers are responsible for any Customs Fees, taxes, tariffs, or other duties incurred.\r\nTracking is always included!\r\nPlease note that some countries will hold packages coming in from out of their country.

Give me a shout!\r\n\r\nAll artwork, reproductions, and images on https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/KustomProducts are copyrighted (c) by Kathleen Cheever. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nCommon Questions:\r\n\r\n1. How long until I get my products?\r\n\r\nProcessing time for all items is 1-2 weeks. Please remember that each item is customized to your specifications and therefore take a little time to create.\r\n\r\n2. I need my items quicker then the processing time offered is this possible?\r\n\r\nYes! Rush processing is available however there will be an extra fee involved. Rush processing fee is based on the number of items, weight of items, where the items will be shipped to, and how quickly those items are needed. All rush processes are &quot;after hours.&quot; No item will reserve priority over another and all items all processed in the order that they are received. If you need an order rushed, the order will be fulfilled after hours so to not effect the order of the other items. Please note that part of the rush processing fee is the cost of an employee working after hours.\r\n\r\n3. What are the extra fees and why are there extra fees?\r\n\r\nThe extra fees will very by item. Some of the extra fees could be:\r\n-Priority Shipping-based on the amount and weight of the item along with where the items need to be shipped to.\r\n-Rush Processing-Please understand that EVERYONE needs\/wants their items as quickly as possible and one customer&#39;s item will for NO reason be placed in priority over another customers item. Because of this all rush processing orders are filled after hours or on weekends and will occur and rush processing fee. All rush processing fees will be in the range of $10-$100 depending on the size of the project and how quickly the items are needed.\r\n\r\n4. What mail carrier do you use and how long will it take to receive my items once they are shipped.\r\n\r\nAt the current time my main provider is USPS with very few packages being shipped out FedEx. USPS website states the following for shipping in the 48 USA:\r\nAll items under 13 oz 2-5 days\r\nAll other items 2-9 days\r\nPriority items 2-3 days\r\nUSPS Shipping outside the USA:\r\nFirst Class Mail 5-16 Business Days\r\nPriority Mail 6-10 Business Days\r\nExpress Mail 3-5 Business Days\r\n\r\n**ALL customs can stop and hold packages for any amount of time and is not covered by shipping times\r\n\r\n5. I am a foreign buyer, what fee will be associated with my package? \r\n\r\nAll countries have their own fee associated with packages being mailed in from a foreign buyer.  Please contact the appropriate government agency to find out what your fees will be.  All packages will be marked as goods sold without exception.  All fees relating to the package within the buyers country will be the responsibility of the buyer.\r\n\r\n6. Do you accept returns?\r\n\r\nNo returns will be accepted on any personalized items.  Do to the customization of the items they can not be resold to another customer and therefore all sales on these items are finial.\r\n\r\n7. Do you accept cancellations on your items?\r\n\r\nCancellations on items will be accepted within a 24 hour time period as long as the item has not been currently worked on or in production. Currently worked on or in production items also includes any custom items that included mock ups\/proofs. Due to the time constants of mock ups\/proofs these items are considered &quot;in production&quot; and cannot be canceled once started. All items that have not been started but are passed the 24 hour time limit will be given as credit of funds towards the shop for a future purchase within 265 day from original purchase date.\r\n \r\n8. Do you do proofs\/mock ups\/pictures of your items?\r\n\r\nDue to work load I do not do proofs\/mock ups\/pictures of items at no cost, doing so would add a 2-4 day extra processing time for all items. The reason is every day I get 25-50 requests for such items, the average mock up\/picture takes 5-20 minutes a piece resulting in 2-17 hours a day. If you would like a proof\/mock up\/picture of your item an extra $5 charge will be added onto your item cost per proof needed.\r\n\r\n9. For custom Images:\r\n\r\nAll images need to be in a vector style format as well as black and white.  A vector image is made up of paths not of pixels which results in clean lines that the laser can read. Any none vector image (.jpg for example) shows pixels which the laser will pick up and engrave onto your objects resulting in an image that will look blurry. The acceptable vector formats are: .ai, .cdr, .eps. Please note that most .png images will not be acceptable. \r\nIf you have an image that is not a vector format such as a .jpg  that you would like to use I can either have a graphic artist trace it out for you at a cost of $25-$50 or you can go to a site such as www.vectormagic.com  where you can sign up for free and get multiple conversions into a vector image. If you go this route I would need the .eps file that you download from the site.\r\nThe cost of a custom item after the black and white vector is received varies on the size of the image and the item the image is to be engraved on. Cost range from $2.50 per item to $40 for large items. If you are looking for multiple items for a company or another occasion discounts for large quantity orders will be given.\r\nAll vector images need to be sent to Kate@KustomProductsInc.com because Etsy does not currently support vector style uploads.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Why are the silver flasks more expensive then the other flasks?\r\n\r\nThe silver flasks cost more then the other flasks due to production costs. In order to produce the mark on a silver flask a marking agent must be used. The marking agent is a very expensive spray that reacts with the heat of the laser.  After the marking agent is placed the item that is being marked the item must be marked at a high heat and at a very low speed that takes 4 times longer then other similar items.\r\n\r\n11. LAYAWAY: I know that wedding budgeting can be tricky and sometime it is just easier to pay a few payments then one lump sum. For that reason layaway will now be available on purchases of $250 or more.  Please read the following rules carefully:\r\n-Layaway is for purchases of $250 or more. If you would like layaway on a purchase less then this please contact me and I will see if something can be arranged.\r\n-A 10% layaway fee will be added to the cost of your order. For a $250 order this would be $25.\r\n-Layaway payments can be made by credit card via Etsy and\/or PayPal. No checks or money orders will be accepted.\r\n-There will be no refunds of money for any lawaway purchases. All money that is currently paid to the shop can be used as shop credit only minus the layaway fee.\r\n-1\/3 is due on purchase, 1\/3 in 30 days, and the balance in 60 days\r\n","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1436894537,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/KustomProducts?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/029\/0\/8619330\/iusb_760x100.12691977_k44j.jpg","num_favorers":472,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":null}},{"listing_id":234313188,"state":"active","user_id":66387693,"category_id":69150425,"title":"You be my glass of wine, I&#39;ll be your shot of Whiskey- Wooden Sign Set","description":"You be my glass of Wine\nI&#39;ll be your shot of Whiskey\nReal Wood- Set (2 Signs included)\n(2) 7.5 x 13 inches \n\nSaw Tooth Hangers on backside","creation_tsz":1444247929,"ending_tsz":1454878729,"original_creation_tsz":1432264773,"last_modified_tsz":1444247929,"price":"20.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["Wine","Sign","Wood","Custom","Bar","Beer","Wedding","Husband","Wife","Whiskey","Wiskey","Gift","Anniversary"],"category_path":["Housewares"],"category_path_ids":[69150425],"materials":[],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1444244288,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/234313188\/you-be-my-glass-of-wine-ill-be-your-shot?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":91,"num_favorers":10,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":null,"processing_max":null,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":891,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":775790332,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1432264773,"listing_id":234313188,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/11134137\/il_75x75.775790332_pdxp.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/11134137\/il_170x135.775790332_pdxp.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/11134137\/il_570xN.775790332_pdxp.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/11134137\/il_fullxfull.775790332_pdxp.jpg","full_height":1238,"full_width":1238}],"Shop":{"shop_id":11134137,"shop_name":"HausByVela","user_id":66387693,"creation_tsz":1431672181,"title":"Haus By Vela","announcement":"Halloween orders must be placed by October 15th to guarantee delivery on time. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for taking a look at our shop, we appreciate your time and interest, \r\n\r\nYvette & Ryan Vela\r\nHaus By Vela","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":"We are expecting our baby any day now, so our shop will remain closed until we are able to adjust to our new lifestyle.

We prefer smooth bottles with a body that&#39;s the same width from top to bottom, and have tall shoulders. You want to avoid wine and champagne bottles have funny shapes or odd textures. To give you a better idea, most Cab and Sauvignon Blanc bottles will work, as well as champagne bottles similar to the shape of  Veuve or Moet Chandon.  You also want  the body to be taller than your custom labels. If the body is too short, you might find the labels will bubble at the top or bottom once applied.\n\n: : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : \n\nHOW DO I REMOVE THE EXISTING WINE LABELS FROM MY BOTTLES?\n\nIt may sound like a daunting task, but it&#39;s really quite easy.

They were each marked &quot;Bourbon Whiskey - Illinois - 1971&quot; so the barrels are at least 40 years old. This charred oak whiskey barrel wood looks amazing inlaid into titanium!

We still make our rings one at a time, for the person ordering. We were one of the first to offer personalized and custom made titanium rings on Etsy and we still offer the same personalized service we always have.\r\n\r\nSizes Available: US 3- US 16 including half and quarter sizes\r\nWidths Available: 3\/16&quot;, 1\/4&quot;, 5\/16&quot;, 3\/8&quot;\r\nEngraving: Up to 20 characters per band\r\n\r\nPlease let us know your size, width, and engraving preferences for each band in the notes to seller box at checkout.

We&#39;re Rob and Leighanne Thompson. We&#39;ve been making and selling our rings here on Etsy for nearly six years now, and we&#39;re looking forward to more great years here. We&#39;ve been married for 19 years and have seven children ages 8-17. We live on a small hobby farm in west Tennesse with our cocker spaniels and a small herd of dairy goats.  We strive to live a simple life (not always easy!) and enjoy gardening, renovating our 1940&#39;s farmhouse, and spending time with our kids.\r\n\r\nAll of our rings are made by us here, on our farm, in our studio. Our rings are still made the same way they were when we started out, one at a time, just for the person ordering. Whenever possible we use stabilized wood and add a water resistant coating for water resistance and durability, and do not charge extra for this. Our desire is to create beautiful, quality pieces at affordable prices. We are not a large company; our work force consists solely of the two of us.\r\n\r\nIf you send us a convo and we don&#39;t get right back to you, please send us another message!  We are mom and dad to seven and our household can get hectic at times =0).  We get so many messages that they can get buried fast, so if we don&#39;t get back with you, just contact us again.  Also, if you message us over the weekend, please be patient with us- if you don&#39;t hear from us on Saturday or Sunday, rest assured that we will reply to your messages on Monday morning. \r\n\r\n*Please Note* that we don&#39;t keep rings in stock.  Every band we make is crafted specifically for the person ordering it.  No two bands will be exactly alike because of our rings&#39; handmade nature.  There are times when we receive more orders than we can keep up with; when this happens, we will not hesitate to close down our shop so that we don&#39;t fall behind with our orders.\r\n\r\nAlso, (and we hate to have to even include this), but please, don&#39;t send us images of someone else&#39;s rings and ask us to make a design that isn&#39;t ours. While we are glad to take custom orders, we won&#39;t make someone else&#39;s design. We will not take on custom work when &quot;copies&quot; of other people&#39;s work are requested, no exceptions.","policy_payment":"We accept PayPal, credit card payments through PayPal, money orders,  personal checks, and cashiers&#39; checks.  Please pay promptly or convo us if you need help with payment.  If you are paying with an e check or personal check, we won&#39;t begin production of your band until payment clears. Also, if you mail in payment, please be sure to include shipping costs in your payment. If you need to cancel an order, please let us know within three days of placing your order as all of our work is custom and by hand.","policy_shipping":"Our wooden and corian bands ship domestically and internationally via First Class Mail. Domestic packages will ship with Delivery Confirmation.  Wooden bands will arrive in a recycled kraft paper box with ribbon.\r\n\r\nAll other bands (titanium, sterling, gold, stainless, and aluminum) ship domestically and internationally via Priority Mail. Domestic packages ship with Delivery Confirmation. These bands arrive in a recycled kraft gift box with ribbon.\r\n\r\nWe are happy to use quicker shipping methods like Priority Mail and Express Mail for exact cost- convo us if you&#39;d like this option. We normally charge for expedited shipping when the ring goes out (so that we are sure to charge you what the USPS charges us, and don&#39;t over or undercharge for this service.) We are also glad to insure your package for exact cost; just let us know if this is something you would like.\r\n\r\nInternational packages do NOT include tracking or Delivery Confirmation.International buyers are responsible for any duties or fees incurred when receiving their packages. Use this link to calculate any duties fees:\r\nwww.dutycalculator.com\/new-import-duty-and-tax-calculation\/","policy_refunds":"The nature of the materials we use most  are such that we can&#39;t resize our bands.  Sometimes we can make them just a bit bigger, but we can&#39;t make existing bands a lot bigger and we can never make them smaller.  Most of the time we have to start over with new rings.  Since a resize is actually a totally new ring, it takes just as much material, work, and time as the original. Therefore, if a band needs to be remade, we  ask for return of the original ring and 50% of the original cost just to cover our materials and part of our time.  Please note also that because resizing or exchanging involves making a new band from scratch that it will take our normal production time to get done.  If you&#39;re unsure of the size you need, please don&#39;t guess at it- let us know that you need some help and we can get some sizers sent out to you.  It is so much easier and better in the long run to take the time in the beginning and get the correct size made the first time around.  Note that we are glad to send sizers free of charge, but we ask that you place your order before we mail the sizer out to you. \r\n\r\nPlease note that our sizes are very presice and they do conform to international sizing specifications. \r\n\r\nIf we can make your ring larger, we ask $10 for this service. We can no longer do this for free but we are striving to keep this as affordable as possible for everyone.\r\n\r\nResizing or remaking a band will take time- at least a few days if we need to make an existing band a bit larger, and regular production time for a remake. \r\n\r\nWe will refund purchase price for the return of a ring if the band is defective in workmanship.  We will not refund the cost of the band because the band doesn&#39;t fit properly (unless the mis size is our fault) or if the buyer just changes their mind. We will also not refund the purchase price of a ring because the wood is not exactly as shown in the listing, etc. Wood is a natural material and we can never match color or grain exactly.","policy_additional":"FAQ\r\n\r\n-HOW DO I LET YOU KNOW MY SIZE, ETC? Let us know the size you need, any special requests (like engraving), and anything else you feel is important about your ring by using the drop down menu, and also in the notes to seller box of checkout. You should put everything you want us to know about your ring here. Convos after the fact are confusing for us and can make the production time of your ring longer. If you add information later on after purchase, we will do our best to make what you need but won&#39;t guarantee the changes. If you do not specify a size when you check out, we&#39;ll make you a standard size 8.\r\n\r\n-WHAT IS YOUR PRODUCTION TIME? Once we have all of the necessary information, expect your ring to take up to four weeks to make. Then please allow us time to package and ship your ring. A few things can delay or prolong your ring&#39;s production:\r\n-not paying promptly\r\n-not giving us a size \r\n-changing your size after we&#39;ve begun a different sized ring\r\n-changing the specifics of your ring after we&#39;ve begun it\r\n-extremely changing or customizing a ring&#39;s design\r\n-requesting materials for your ring that we don&#39;t keep in stock\r\n-not giving us all of the specifics about your ring in the notes to seller box of checkout\r\nWhile we are glad to give an estimated completion time for custom orders, we ask that you take our estimate as just that- an estimate. When we are making something totally custom, it can take longer than expected.\r\nAlso, if you contact us and ask us if we can complete a ring by a certain date, we will let you know if we can do it or not. If you wait a week or more after checking with us, we may or may not be able to complete your ring by the original deadline stated. If you have a deadline, please check with us before you order and remind us of it in the notes to seller box.\r\n\r\n-DO YOU OFFER ANY GUARANTEES ON YOUR RINGS? Yes, we do.  We will repair any damage to rings we make within 3 months of receiving the ring for no charge.  After this time, repair of wood inlays will cost $10 plus shipping.  Also, gemstone placement is guaranteed for three months as well.  Customer designed rings (ring styles that we don&#39;t normally offer in our shop but are made by special request) are not guaranteed at all.\r\n\r\n-CAN I SWIM\/BATHE\/SHOWER\/WASH MY HANDS WHILE WEARING A  WOOD RING? Our wood and wood inlay rings are quite durable and long lasting. Most of the varieties of wood we use are stabilized for water resistance, and all are given a  water resistant coating. We do not charge extra for this but do it as a matter of course, because we want everyone&#39;s band to be long lasting and durable. While this affords a huge amount of protection against water, over time the finish can be damaged. Therefore we suggest caution with water, and as always, if your inlay is ever damaged, we can replace it for only $10 for as long as you own your ring. \r\n\r\n-I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT SIZE RING I WEAR... CAN YOU HELP ME?  Sure.  If you don&#39;t know what size ring you  need, we will be glad to mail you a ring sizer free of charge, after you purchase the style ring you would like. \r\n\r\n **If you get sized at a department store jewelry counter or another jeweler, we will not be responsible for mis sizes.  Unfortunately not all sizers and mandrels are created equally.  The best way to figure size if you really don&#39;t know is to get the sizers sent =0).**\r\n\r\n-CAN YOU DO HALF AND QUARTER SIZES?  Yes, we can do half and quarter sizes. \r\n\r\n-CAN YOU CUSTOMIZE A RING FOR ME? OR USE A DIFFERENT STONE\/WOOD\/METAL?  Yes, in most cases.  We&#39;ll definitely do what we can to make just what you&#39;re looking for.  Just convo us with what you&#39;d like us to make and we&#39;ll let you know if it&#39;s something we can do. Also, once you&#39;ve discussed a custom band with us and you order, please remember to put any special requests and changes in the notes to seller section of checkout- it helps us tremendously to have all of the information we need in one place.  We reserve the right to photograph and use custom designs for future sales and listings.\r\n\r\n-CAN YOU ENGRAVE YOUR RINGS? Yes, we can.  Engraving costs $10 and there are seperate listings for it in our shop. The character limit, including spaces, is 20 characters. You must purchase a listing for engraving and let us know the engraving you need in the notes to seller box when you check out. We can no longer offer this service for free, but we&#39;re working to keep it as affordable as possible.\r\n\r\n-HOW DO I CONTACT YOU?  Through Etsy conversations only, please.  This is the best way to make sure that we see your message in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n-I ORDERED A RING AND IT&#39;S GREAT, BUT I ORDERED THE WRONG SIZE... CAN YOU RESIZE IT?   The nature of the materials we use most  are such that we can&#39;t resize our bands.  Sometimes we can make them just a bit bigger, but we can&#39;t make existing bands a lot bigger and we can never make them smaller.  Most of the time we have to start over with new rings.  Since a resize is actually a totally new ring, it takes just as much material, work, and time as the original. Therefore, if a band needs to be remade, we  ask for return of the original ring and 50% of the original cost just to cover our materials and part of our time.  Please note also that because resizing or exchanging involves making a new band from scratch that it will take our normal production time to get done.  If you&#39;re unsure of the size you need, please don&#39;t guess at it- let us know that you need some help and we can get some sizers sent out to you.  It is so much easier and better in the long run to take the time in the beginning and get the correct size made the first time around.  Note that we are glad to send sizers free of charge, but please only request them if you intend, seriously, to purchase a band from our shop (so that we can keep these sizers free for those who need them =0).)\r\n\r\n-MY RING DOESN&#39;T LOOK LIKE THE ONE IN THE LISTING.  WHAT DID YOU DO WRONG AND HOW CAN YOU FIX IT?  Wood is organic and there is no way we can duplicate an exact grain pattern or color from ring to ring- it can vary quite a bit in even the same small piece of wood.  Understand that, like snowflakes, no two pieces of wood are exactly alike (the same is true of our random mokume pattern- we just can&#39;t recreate the pattern in the picture exactly.) Also, every ring we make is handmade- we don&#39;t have any sort of assembly line set up and there are going to be tiny differences from ring to ring just because we *can&#39;t* make rings exactly alike with our current production methods. Embrace this and be happy to know that no one else in the whole world has a ring just like yours =0).\r\n\r\n-CAN WE MEET YOU IN PERSON TO DISCUSS COMMISSIONING A RING?  Yes, although we will still work the sale through Etsy.  We have met a lot of wonderful Etsy folks from all over the country, and we&#39;re always glad to make time for this.  Just let us know when you need to meet so that we can plan accordingly.  \r\n\r\n-CAN WE TOUR YOUR STUDIO?  Yes, if you will give us time to plan accordingly =0). We do have seven kids and they tend to get a little messy- we need time to control the chaos before visitors arrive, so just let us know so that we can plan (and clean like mad, lol.)\r\n\r\n-CAN TITANIUM BE CUT OFF IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY?  In most cases, yes.  It&#39;s a myth that titanium is so hard that it can&#39;t be cut off in emergency room situations (although some grades are actually too hard to cut, the ones we use aren&#39;t and we cut both commercially pure and aerospace titanium daily with the simplest of tools and no problems)... however, we can&#39;t be held responsible if the unthinkable happens and for misinformed ER workers.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1424452362,"vacation_autoreply":"Rings by Rob and Lean is on vacation!
